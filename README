Uniting cscope with vim. Instead of going into the csope UI, you just need to enter the search term and it will populate the vim-unite interface with the results.
This is a package similar to my other package (https://www.github.com/amitab/atom-cscope)

PS: I just learnt vim scripting recently and there may be mistakes/better way of doing things. 
If you find any problems, please let me know.
